An esp32-lolin based pocket smart device. Uses a Rotary Encoder and an OLED Display connected to the microcontroller to interact with GUI
This repository contains the code for ESP-IDF to program the esp32 to create a GUI interface which uses a circular looped menu and text tiles for items. Will add pinout details and more documentation soon. Plan is to implement nested menu systems and press and long press forward and backward navigation functions.

This projects ultimate goal is to become a security device for passive, on the move, penetration testing. Eventually I want to make it more of an all rounder with features like android app interface to control the unutilised io, monitor device status and provide ota updates.
